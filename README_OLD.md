### Note
----------------------------

By default, root has permissions to run dmidecode, hdparm and fdisk. If you are running auto-discover as non-root user, you would need following in your */etc/sudoers file.*

	%<user-group-here> ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/dmidecode,/sbin/hdparm,/sbin/fdisk



If this permission is missing, auto-discovery client would not be able to find out hardware, manufacturer and serial # etc.

You might also have to comment out Default Requiretty in */etc/sudoers file*.
